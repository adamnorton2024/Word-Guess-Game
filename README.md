# Word-Guess-Game

This was a challening, yet fun project to create.  I do find the game also to be a challening yet fun.  

1. To Start the Game, simply press any key. 
2. Once game is started, press keys on your keyboard to make your guesses. 
3. If you are correct, the letter will be filled it.  If not, your number of guesses will be reduced. 
4. Keep guessing until you either spell the entire word for the win, or are out of guesses and lose.
